= How to run tests =

You can use `run.sh` to run all the test for an exercice. It takes two parameters,
the test suite to run and the root of your project. For instance, if you have your
project C-02 stored in projects/c-02 you will run it like this:

```shell
/path/to/run.sh C-02 projects/c-02
```
